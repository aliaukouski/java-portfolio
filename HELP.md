# Java Portfolio Help

Welcome to my Java Portfolio. This repository showcases a collection of Java projects that demonstrate practical skills in backend development, WebSocket communication, database integration, and modern application architecture. Each project is self-contained, with clean code, structured modules, and working examples.

## Purpose

The goal of this portfolio is to provide a clear view of my abilities as a Java developer. It is designed for:

- Reviewing my coding style and architecture decisions.
- Demonstrating practical implementations of backend features.
- Showing experience with databases, REST APIs, and WebSocket communication.

## Projects Overview

Each project is located in its own folder within this repository. Currently included projects:

- **multiuser-chat** – A real-time chat application using Spring Boot and WebSocket.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the project folder you are interested in.
2. Follow the README or project-specific instructions for building and running the application.
3. Explore the source code to see how functionality is implemented.

> Note: All projects are for demonstration purposes. The code is open for viewing only and cannot be reused without explicit permission.
